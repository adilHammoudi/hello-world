# hello-world
My first repository on Github.

Hi people,
I've just discovered again this Github I've used one time at school for fun. But today I need it for a serious project. So what about me? I'm a junior developer in a great IT Japanese company. I like discovering new technologies, new paradigms, new scientific things. 
I'm not yet young, not yet old, I live quite well thanks to God. I like reading, swimming, chilling with friends and every day is a new day, a new challenge, not always easy but I do my best to experiment happiness at each second. Blablabla what else about me? ... 
See you on Github!
